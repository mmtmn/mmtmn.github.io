        <h1>Cyber Slayer</h1>

        <h1>Campaign</h1>

        <p>
            The campaign aspect of CyberSlayer is a decision based rpg, with pokemon like graphics. 
            <br>
            The decisions you take are the core of your gameplay: if you die, you lose all the progress you’ve made and will start from scratch, you may choose to join a criminal faction and play the game as a 3d shooter, or study, keeping a low profile while taking quizzes to gain abilities, or explore the world to find hidden items.
        </p>




        <h1>Multiplayer</h1>

        <p>
            The multiplayer is linked to the progress you’ve made in the campaign. If you die in the multiplayer you also lose all the progress you’ve made in the campaign. There will be two options: PvP or BvB, Person versus Person or Brain versus Brain. 
            <br>    
            In the PvP it will be more closely related to the third person shooter, while the BvB will be a question answering quick quiz.
            <br>
            Both will have ranking systems, ranking from Bronze to CyberSlayer. 
        </p>

        <h1>Education</h1>
        
        <p>
            <br>
            Gamification of Education processes has been a long standing challenge. The approach here is not to portray (to the user) that education is the main goal, but rather have education be a subtle side-effect of the main entertainment pursuit. What better than a game where, by the way, you learn something new. Further, you might even discover and get to grow a brand new interest.
            <br>
            Educational challenges and lessons in various fields will be available (Math, Football (Soccer), Science, Languages). Rewards will be intricately related to broader gameplay.
        </p>

        <h1>Finance</h1>
        
        <p>
            The game will be looking into getting sold on Steam, PSN Store and Xbox Store.
            <br>
            Every month, the number 1 rated player will get a % of the liquid profits of the company. This way, it’ll become one of the most competitive games, instantly rewarding its best players.
            <br>
            We’ll encourage the top player to stream their gameplay, or create YouTube content, to attract more users, and thus, get a bigger reward at the end of the month.
        </p>
